# Etch-a-Sketch
## Description
This project creates an Etch-a-Sketch for the user to play with. The goal of this project was mainly to practice my web development skills and demonstrate a basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS. Problems related to using git, maintaining git workflow, recovering old code snapshots and using flexbox in an actual application are novel issues that I ran into. Solving these issues has helped me further develop my skills in website development and has highlighted the value of maintaining an organized git workflow. 

This project is completed in the sense that I have practiced the skills I wanted to and is not intended for further work, either by myself or others.
